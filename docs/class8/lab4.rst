Lab 3: Introduction to the F5 Cloud Failover Extension
====================================================

The purpose of this lab is to install the cloud failover extension after deploying your API based failover google cloud template.

The F5 cloud failover extension has three main benefits:

Standardization: Failover patterns will look similar across all clouds.
Portability: You can leverage a variety of methods, including cloud-native templates, Terraform, and Ansible, to install and run CF.
Lifecycle and Supportability: You can upgrade BIG-IP without having to call F5 support to fix failover.
